This project serves the following purposes:

Document and demonstrate Java language features
Document and demonstrate the best Java programming practices
Document and demonstrate the best Java project layout practices

If you see a mistake, please do not hesitate to leave a comment. I did my best to find and organize as much information
regarding professional Java development as I could, but I am not a full-time Java developer.
